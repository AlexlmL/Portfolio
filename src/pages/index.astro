        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Software Engineering student at UPC with a strong interest in back-end and
            full-stack development. I enjoy building clean, functional interfaces and
            collaborating on backend solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value transparency in both teamwork and technology. I am especially
            interested in open-source projects and in building software that promotes
            free access to knowledge, collaboration, and shared growth within the
            developer community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe software should be understandable, reusable, and accessible,
            and I aim to apply these principles in both academic and professional
            projects.
